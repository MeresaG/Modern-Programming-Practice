It doesn't make any sense to use inheritance in the Cylinder and Circle objects.
Because we are using the inheritance for the sake of code reuse but
a circle is not a cylinder and this violates the IS-a relationship.
we can't also use the circle object in run time and this violates the LSP relationship
