i)
- If the method stayed abstract or not implemented by both B and C then D would just
	override the method as required. Then D have to override the method() no matter the
	implementation from interfaces B and C.
- If there was a default implementation in either B or C then D would not have to
	implement the method unless required.
- If both B and C implemented their own implementation of the method, then D would
	have to implement its own implementation as well.


ii)
- If the method() was not implemented in both B and C. The D would not require doing
	any thing because it would still be abstract in D
- If the method () was implemented as default in either B or C. The D would not require
doing anything because it would still have a default implementation

- If the method () was implemented in both B and C as default then D need to
	implement its default methods or Interface D should put the method as an abstract method.
